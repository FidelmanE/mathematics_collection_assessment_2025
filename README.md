math2025subjectdatawithisbnissn extracts titles by subject from raw MARC for both print and electronic resources.

math2025kbartdatafinal20250515 merges combined usage data with the KBART to get an OCLC number as well as print and electronic identifier (ISBN/ISSN), then joins to titles by subject from math2025subjectdatawithisbnissn on OCLC number, then online and print identifiers to 020 and 022 ISBN and ISSN fields in MARC, to produce usage data by subject.

mathwoscitationdatafinal uses CrossRef API calls to associate WOS citations with ISBN/ISSN's by DOI, then compares citations to our holdings by ISBN/ISSN and publication year to determine how many materials cited by WVU researchers are held in Libraries collections.
